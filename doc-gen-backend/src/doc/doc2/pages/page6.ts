The drug product filter and clarifying filter component materials have been found to be non-toxic per the USP Class VI Biological Test for Plastics . A study was conducted to identify potential leachables from the various filters used in drug product manufacture.  The maximum amount of each extracted compound as a potential leachable was assessed.  The results from this study were then used to assess the potential impact to the Mounjaro drug product process.  The minimum batch size and maximum dose were used to compare the concentration of each potential leachable to a toxicological limit.  This risk assessment found that all of the compounds observed in the extraction study would be lower than the safety concern threshold.  Under aggressive extraction conditions, the human health risk assessment identified no potential leachables above the patient safety threshold .   ',size:20

The vessel film and various component materials including connectors and tubing for each vessel assembly have been found to be non-toxic per the USP Class VI Biological Test for Plastics .  Results from extractable studies were used to conduct a risk assessment to identify potential leachables from the vessels used in Mounjaro drug product manufacture in B100 PFS3.   The maximum amount of each extracted compound was assessed including a cumulative impact from all vessels used in the Mounjaro drug product B100 PFS3 manufacturing process.  The minimum batch size and maximum dose were used to compare the concentration of each potential leachable to a toxicological limit .  None of the organic chemical entities in individual vessels were present at concentrations greater than the Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) of 18 Âµg/mL, and all cumulative potential leachables across all the vessels were below the AET.   All reported elemental impurities at a concentration above the reporting limit were evaluated as potential leachables and were calculated to have a margin of safety >1.    Therefore no potential leachables in the Mounjaro drug product process in B100 PFS3 would be expected to be present above the patient safety threshold. ',size:20
